                    <h1 class="pt-5">What are the differences between map, filter, forEach, and find ?</h1>
                    <h5>1. Map:<br>The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function
                        on every element in the original array. It returns a new array with the same number of elements
                        as the original array, but with each element transformed based on the function provided. The
                        original array is not modified.<br><br> 2. Filter:<br>The filter() method creates a new array
                        with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a new
                        array with only the elements that meet the condition specified in the function. The original
                        array is not modified. <br><br> 3. forEach:<br>The forEach() method executes a provided function
                        once for each array element. It does not return anything and is used when we want to perform a
                        certain action for each element in the array. <br><br> 4. Find: <br>The find() function returns
                        the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition specified in a function. It
                        returns undefined if no element satisfies the condition.</h5>

                    <h1 class="pt-5">What are the differences between Local Storage, Session Storage and Cookies ?</h1>
                    <h5>1. Local Storage:<br>Local storage is a feature introduced in HTML5 that allows websites to
                        store data on a user's computer. The data stored in local storage is persistent, which means it
                        will remain even after the browser is closed. Local storage has a larger storage capacity than
                        cookies and session storage, typically around 5-10 MB. Local storage data is accessible by any
                        page from the same origin.<br><br>2. Session Storage:<br>Session storage is also introduced in
                        HTML5, and it is similar to local storage. The main difference between local storage and session
                        storage is that session storage data is cleared when the user closes the browser. Session
                        storage is useful for storing temporary data that needs to be kept around for a short period,
                        such as form data or user preferences. Session storage also has a larger storage capacity than
                        cookies, typically around 5-10 MB. Session storage data is accessible by any page from the same
                        origin and within the same session.<br><br>3. Cookies:<br>Cookies are small text files that are
                        stored on the user's computer by websites. Cookies are often used to store user preferences or
                        login information, and they can also be used for tracking user behavior across websites. Cookies
                        have a smaller storage capacity than local storage and session storage, typically around 4 KB.
                        Cookies can be set with an expiration date, after which they will be deleted. Cookies can be
                        accessed by any page from the same domain that created them.

                    <h1 class="pt-5">What is event loop in JavaScript?</h1>
                    <h5>
                        Event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism through which the 'calls waiting for execution' in the
                        callback queue/job queue can be put on the call stack. For any event from the callback queue/job
                        queue to come to call stack, the call stack will have to be empty.
                    </h5>
